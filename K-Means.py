"""***Comparing Performances of Cost Functions between Eucledian and Manhattan in K-Means:***

From the graphs plotted for both the cost functions of Eucledian and Manhattan it is observable that the cost values obtained for each iteration for a Eucledian function have higher associated values and they decrease in a exponential manner.

On observing the cost values obtained for each iteration for Manhattan function have lower associated values and they decrease in an exponential manner with some slight changes at a few iterations and later they decrease for the next set of iterations.

So, we can observe that Eucledian distance measurement has higher performance than the Manhattan distance measurement since the data considered is obtained for lower dimensional data.
